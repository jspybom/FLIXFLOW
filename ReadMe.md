## The Challenge: Delivering Flawless Video in a Competitive Market

The Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming market is incredibly competitive. To succeed, a new platform needs more than just great content—it requires a flawless technical execution. The primary challenge was to build a robust, scalable, and secure streaming service that could deliver high-quality video content to thousands of concurrent users with minimal latency and buffering.

The client needed a partner who understood the complexities of video transcoding, secure content delivery, and building an intuitive user experience that could rival industry giants.

### Key Features

* **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** We implemented an adaptive streaming protocol that automatically adjusts the video quality based on the user's network speed. This drastically reduces buffering and ensures a continuous viewing experience, even on slower connections.

* **Personalized Content Discovery:** The platform features a sophisticated recommendation engine that analyzes viewing history to suggest relevant movies and shows, increasing user engagement and retention.

* **Cross-Platform Experience:** A seamless experience across all devices. Users can start watching on their phone during their commute and pick up right where they left off on their web browser at home.

* **Secure Digital Rights Management (DRM):** To protect content from piracy, we integrated robust DRM solutions, ensuring compliance with studio and distributor requirements.

## Technology Stack

Building a world-class streaming service requires a specialized and highly scalable tech stack. We leveraged industry-leading cloud services and frameworks to ensure reliability and performance.

* **Cross-Platform App:** **React Native** was used to build the iOS and Android applications, allowing for a consistent user experience and rapid development.
* **Backend:** A scalable backend was built with **Node.js** and hosted on AWS, designed to handle millions of API calls.
* **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS):** We utilized a suite of Amazon Web Services for the heavy lifting:
    * **AWS S3:** For secure and durable video file storage.
    * **AWS Elemental MediaConvert:** For automated video transcoding into various formats and bitrates.
    * **Amazon CloudFront:** As the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver video to users globally with low latency.
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL** was used for managing user data, subscriptions, and content metadata.
